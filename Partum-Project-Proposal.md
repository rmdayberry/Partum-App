# Project Proposal: Pregnancy and Postpartum Education App

## 

## Tech Stack

* Frontend (Mobile & Web):  
  * React: For building the web application, ensuring a consistent and interactive user experience across platforms.  
  * React Native: For later developing a cross-platform mobile application that runs on iOS and Android using a single codebase.  
* Backend:  
  * Node.js with Express: For handling API requests, server-side logic, and integration with the database.  
* Database:  
  * MongoDB: A NoSQL database to store and manage static content and any additional data needed by the application.  
* Content Management:  
  * Strapi or Contentful: Headless CMS to manage and deliver static content through an API.  
* Hosting:  
  * Heroku: For deploying and scaling the backend services.  
  * Vercel or Netlify: For hosting the web frontend.

## Focus of the Project

The project will be an evenly focused full-stack application, integrating both frontend and backend components. The aim is to create a seamless and cohesive user experience across web and eventually mobile platforms, ensuring that users can access educational content easily and intuitively.

## Project Type

* Website: A web application accessible through modern browsers.  
* (later) Mobile App: Cross-platform application for iOS and Android.

## Project Goal

The goal of the project is to provide accessible, evidence-based educational content for pregnancy and postpartum care. The app will serve as a reliable resource for expectant and new parents, offering valuable information and guidance during this critical period.

## User Demographic

The primary users of the app will be:

* Expectant Parents: Individuals preparing for childbirth and seeking information on pregnancy.  
* New Parents: Individuals looking for guidance on postpartum care and early parenting.  
* Healthcare Professionals: Midwives and other healthcare providers seeking a reliable resource to share with their patients.

## Data and API

* Data: The content will include educational articles, tips, and multimedia resources related to pregnancy and postpartum care.  
* Data Collection: Content will be managed using a headless CMS (Strapi or Contentful) and delivered via an API to both the mobile app and website.  
* API: The API will provide endpoints for retrieving content, including articles, tips, and multimedia resources. The API may be custom-built or integrated with the CMS API.

## Project Approach

1. Database Schema  
   * Content: Stores articles, tips, and multimedia resources with fields such as title, body, category, and media URLs.  
   * Categories: Stores categories for organizing content (e.g., Pregnancy, Postpartum, Newborn Care).  
2. Potential API Issues  
   * Data Consistency: Ensuring content is consistently delivered across platforms.  
   * Scalability: Handling increasing amounts of data and user requests efficiently.  
   * Error Handling: Managing and reporting API errors to ensure a smooth user experience.  
3. Sensitive Information  
   * No sensitive or personal data will be collected or handled. The focus is on delivering static educational content.  
4. Functionality  
   * Content Display: Users can view educational articles, tips, and multimedia resources.  
   * Search and Filter: Users can search for and filter content based on categories and keywords.  
5. User Flow  
   * Homepage: Displays featured content and navigation options.  
   * Content Pages: Users can access detailed articles and resources.  
   * Search/Filter: Users can search for specific topics and filter content by category.  
6. Stretch Goals  
   * Mobile version of website  
   * User Feedback: Incorporate a feedback system to gather user insights and improve content.  
   * Interactive Features: Add features like quizzes or interactive tools to enhance user engagement.  
   * Multi-language Support: Expand content accessibility by offering multiple language options.
